Releases
========
*Version 6.0.1*
- Allow NULL values for daily schedule, exception schedule and schedule default
- Fix scheduling issues when TimeValue sequences are not in chronological order
- Fix schedule object using incorrect time format to trigger next update
- Add new CacheUpdate option to the startRemoteDeviceDiscovery() method of LocalDevice 

*Version 6.0.0*
- fix DeviceObjectTest.timeSynchronization test to pass
- IAmRequest no longer automatically gets the extended device information this must now be done by adding an `IAmRequestListener` or using `DiscoveryUtils.getExtendedDeviceInformation(d1, rd);` The extended device info no longer retrieved is:
    * PropertyIdentifier.protocolServicesSupported
    * PropertyIdentifier.objectName
    * PropertyIdentifier.protocolVersion
    * PropertyIdentifier.vendorIdentifier
    * PropertyIdentifier.modelName
    * PropertyIdentifier.maxSegmentsAccepted
- Only update a cached device's address if the NPCI data has the source specifier flag set
- Allow overriding the ScheduledExecutorService used by the LocalDevice

*Version 5.0.2*
- Relax restriction on reading values that are invalid by only validating values when they are written to our device

*Version 5.0.1*
- Fix Door Status values for none=5, closing=6, opening=7, safetyLocked=8 limitedOpened=9

*Version 5.0.0*
- Fully BTL Certifiable
- Support up to 255 segments when sending a request and response
- Bugfix to allow setReuseAddress to work correctly when using BACnetIP
- Bugfix to ensure the propertyArrayIndex is correctly returned when reading via callback in RequestUtils
- Change to Maven Eclipse Project
- Modify RequestUtil.readProperties() to attempt to request sequenced values if they are too large and would cause a segmentationNotSupported response
- Modify RequestUtilsreadProperties() to optionally allow returning null values

*Version 4.1.7*

- Fixes for reading elements of priority array

*Version 3.2.4*
- Fixing bug in SerialPortWrapper where stop bits and data bits were reversed.

*Version 3.2.3
- Removed restriction on binding LocalDevice to 0.0.0.0
- Added code to ensure DefaultTransport thread can't die from a bad expire() call
- Added code to ServiceFutureImpl to allow using timeouts
- Using timeouts in DefaultTransport for ServiceFutures

*Version 3.2 release notes*
- Added BBMD support
- Much enhanced support for acting as a foreign device
- Improved test framework

*Version 3.0 release notes*
- The ANT build system has been replaced with Gradle
- Dependencies have been removed. BACnet4J now operates without any external libs
- Support for IPv6 added
- Ad hoc test code has begun to be replaced with JUnit tests 
- Blocking request calls have been replaced with non-blocking promises/callbacks
- Added implementations of many objects, including analog value, binary output, binary value, calendar, multistate value, notification classes, and schedules.
- Added intrinsic alarming for implemented objects
- Added COV reporting
- Many bug fixes and minor enhancements

*Version 2.0 release notes*

The networking package of this product has been pretty much entirely rewritten to support MS/TP. These changes implied many changes to the LocalDevice public interface, so if you were using version 1.x you will need to port some code to upgrade.
